## Core Objective
The main goal of this project is to investigate the effect of initial conditions on star formation within a cellular automaton (CA) model. By altering the initial mass and spatial distributions, we aim to understand the parameters that significantly influence the emergence of stars in our simulated universe.

## Research Question
The primary research question addresses the impact of spatial distribution on star formation within a CA framework:
> Investigation into how the initial conditions affects star formation within a cellular automaton (CA) model 

> What is the effect of the spatial distribution of initial conditions on a cellular automata star formation model?


## Hypothesis
Our null hypothesis (H0) states:
> Variations in initial mass distributions in the simulated space will significantly influence star formation.


## Getting Started
To run this simulation, you will need Python and the following dependencies installed:
```
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

### File Descriptions
`Agent.py`: Defines the Agent class, which represents astrophysical entities in the simulation.
CellularAutomaton.py: Contains the CellularAutomaton class that models the cellular space and rules for star formation.
`Group.py`: Contains the Group class for managing collections of agents.
`main.py`: The main script for initializing and running the simulation.
### Results
the results of the simulation are depicted in the `Resultdisplay.GIF` file and `results`directory, illustrating the progression of star formation in the CA grid.


A few essential functions have tests in the `tests`directory

## Prerequisites
A `requirements.txt` file has been provided, this should install any necessary libraries
